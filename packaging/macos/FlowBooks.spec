# -*- mode: python ; coding: utf-8 -*-
# PyInstaller spec for the native macOS build (.app bundle).
#
# STARTING POINT — adapted from packaging/windows/FlowBooks.spec and
# not yet validated on real Apple hardware. Expected iteration areas:
#   * WeasyPrint natives: on macOS these come from Homebrew (pango,
#     fontconfig, gobject-introspection). PyInstaller's hooks usually pick
#     the dylibs up automatically from the brew prefix; if PDF rendering
#     fails in the frozen app, stage them explicitly like the Windows
#     build stages its gtk-dlls.
#   * pywebview uses the Cocoa/WebKit backend on macOS (pyobjc) — no
#     pythonnet, no WebView2, one less runtime dependency than Windows.
#   * Icon: assets/icon-256.png → .icns (see the workflow step).
