# Built by .github/workflows/windows.yml on standard CPython (NOT MSYS2
# python — pywebview needs pythonnet/.NET, which mingw python can't load).
# WeasyPrint's native dependencies (Pango/GObject/HarfBuzz/Fontconfig DLLs)
# are staged from MSYS2 into gtk-dlls/ by the workflow and bundled under
# _internal/gtk/; desktop_launcher.py points WEASYPRINT_DLL_DIRECTORIES at
# that folder before anything imports weasyprint.
