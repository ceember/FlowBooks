# ============================================================================
# Stored files — every file a company keeps, inside its own database.
#
# The company logo, attachments on invoices, bills and the rest, employee
# documents (the W-4s and I-9s) and scanned receipts waiting to be attached
# all used to be written into one "uploads" folder that every company on a
# desktop install shared. Two companies' invoice #1 "receipt.pdf" were the
# same file, and so was every company's logo (2.18.0 gate: skytech, macbase1
# NEW-14). Now the bytes live here, one row per upload, so a company is one
# file again: a backup, a restore or a copy of it carries every file it has.
