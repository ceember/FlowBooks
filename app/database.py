#   max_overflow=20     burst capacity when analytics + concurrent users hit
#   pool_recycle=1800   recycle every 30 min to avoid stale TCP idle kills
#   pool_pre_ping=True  cheap SELECT 1 before each checkout; catches dead conns
#   pool_use_lifo=True  reuse hottest conn first -> better CPU cache locality
# SQLite URLs skip pool_size/max_overflow since SQLite uses a different strategy.
