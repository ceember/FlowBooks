# ============================================================================
# FlowBooks — "It's like QuickBooks, but we own the source code"
# An independent, from-scratch replacement for Intuit QuickBooks Pro 2003.
# No Intuit source code or binaries were decompiled, disassembled, or used.
# Everything derives from published SDK documentation (QBFC 5.0, qbXML 4.0),
# IIF files exported by our own licensed copy, and 14 years of using the
# product as a paying customer. Intuit's activation servers have been dead
# since ~2017; the hard drive with our licensed copy died in 2024. We just
# want to print invoices.

    at a database behind the migration head and it half-upgrades it: tables
    the new revision ADDS are created, tables it ALTERS are untouched, and
    `alembic_version` does not move. Alembic can then never run on that
    database again — the upgrade tries to create tables that already exist.

    The damage is silent at the moment it happens and loud much later, in a
    different session, as a start failure with no obvious cause.

    Neither shipped path reaches it: `desktop_launcher.py` runs
    `alembic upgrade head` before serving, and `docker-entrypoint.sh` runs it
    at line 21. A self-managed deployment that sets DATABASE_URL, runs
    uvicorn directly and treats migrations as a separate step is on exactly
    that path — and so is `--_serve`, which is how the agent met it.

# specifically because llms.txt and ai/agents-template.md tell agents to
# "discover endpoints from the spec; do not guess paths": a client generated
# from the spec emitted no Authorization header and 401'd on every call.

# Applied globally, with the genuinely public routes exempted so the document
