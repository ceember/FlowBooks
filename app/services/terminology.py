"""Terminology — the words a company sees, decided by Settings -> company_type.

A nonprofit never sells anything, so "Customer", "Invoice", "Sales Receipt"
and "Profit & Loss" are wrong on every screen and every printed page.
Instead of a second set of pages, one dictionary swaps the visible words
at render time: Customer -> Donor, Invoice -> Pledge, Class -> Fund, Profit
& Loss -> Statement of Activities. Nothing in the API, the database or the
export formats changes name; a business company sees no difference.

This is the server twin of ``app/static/js/terms.js`` — the two
dictionaries must agree (``tests/test_terminology.py`` checks). Keys are
ALWAYS the business words. Bare "Sales", "Vendor", "Bill", "Estimate" and
"Payment" are deliberately not keys: phrases carry the swap, so "Sales Tax"
can never become "Contributions Tax".
