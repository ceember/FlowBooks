# ============================================================================
# Multi-currency helpers.
#
# Design: the GENERAL LEDGER is single-currency (the home currency from
# settings). Foreign-currency documents store their own currency + the
# exchange rate they were booked at; every journal line they post is
# converted to home currency at that rate. This keeps every existing GL
# invariant (books balance, void symmetry, report math) untouched — the
# dimension lives on documents, not on ledger lines.
#
# Realized FX gain/loss appears when cash settles at a different rate
# than the document was booked at (customer payments). It posts to a
# dedicated expense account (get-or-create, number 6999) — a debit there
# is a loss, a credit a gain.
