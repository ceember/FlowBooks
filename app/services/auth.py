# Passwords hashed with argon2id, sessions via Starlette SessionMiddleware
# (signed cookie). Two shapes, one code path:
#   - Single-operator (desktop default): one password, no username asked.
#     Backed by the settings-table hash AND a single admin user row.
#   - Server Edition multi-user: the users table is the principal model;
#     username+password once a second user exists. RBAC enforcement is
#     layered separately.
