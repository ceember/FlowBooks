"""Documents the QuickBooks Online import created, acted on here.

The QBO import brings invoices, sales receipts and payments in as documents
without a posting of their own. The ledger import (Posted Ledger Activity)
posts QBO's own lines for each one, as a journal mapped by its QBO
transaction ("Invoice:130", "Sales Receipt:132", "Payment:131").

A person here voids or edits such a document like any other:

- its import posting is reversed with it (the usual reversing entry, keyed
  by the transaction it reverses);
- an edit makes it an ordinary document of ours, with a posting of its own
  (the import's one reversed first, so A/R is never counted twice);
- the import mappings are marked CHANGED_HERE, so a later import leaves it
  alone instead of posting it again.
