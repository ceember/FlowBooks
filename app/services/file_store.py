# ============================================================================
# File store — a company's files, kept in its own database (stored_files).
#
# Every upload is a row of its own: the logo, attachments, employee
# documents and scanned receipts. Nothing is written to disk, so two
# companies can never land on one file, an updated "W-4.pdf" never replaces
# the first, and a backup of the company's database carries every file.
