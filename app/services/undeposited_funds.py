"""Undeposited Funds as a list of items waiting for the bank.

A payment received into Undeposited Funds (1200) debits it; Make Deposits
moves a batch of those to a bank account with one entry (DR bank, CR
1200), as QuickBooks does. The deposit used to forget which payments it
took. Nothing then stopped a deposited payment — even one whose deposit
had been reconciled with a bank statement — from being voided: the void
credited 1200 a second time and drove it negative while the deposit still
claimed the money (explore 2.17.3, W-H4). The Make Deposits list, rebuilt
by netting every credit against every debit newest-first, also showed a
voided payment as waiting and hid a live one.

Now:

- an ITEM is a debit on 1200 from a transaction that is not void and is
  not itself a void's reversal;
- a deposit made from the list stamps each item's line with its journal
  entry (``TransactionLine.deposit_transaction_id``); voiding the deposit
  clears the stamp, and the payments are waiting again;
- a deposit that names no items — made before deposits kept their list,
  imported from QuickBooks, or posted by hand — is netted against the
  OLDEST waiting items, which is how a person deposits.
