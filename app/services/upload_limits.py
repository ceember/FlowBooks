# ============================================================================
# Upload size limits — shared guard for every file-upload endpoint.
#
# Reading `await file.read()` unbounded lets one authenticated request
# buffer an arbitrarily large body into memory. Every upload route reads
# through read_limited() instead, with a cap matched to what the endpoint
# actually ingests. Logo uploads (app/routes/uploads.py) and attachments
# (app/routes/attachments.py) had their own caps first; the constants
# here centralize the policy for the import endpoints.
#
# Ported concept from the joelmacklow fork's upload_limits service.
