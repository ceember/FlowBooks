The IRS language lives here once (Publication 1771): a written
acknowledgment states the amount, the date, and either that no goods or

estimate of what was (the gala dinner) so the deductible portion is
clear. For property the charity describes it and never values it. The
donation receipt, the acknowledgment letter and the year-end giving
