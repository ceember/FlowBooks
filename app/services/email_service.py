    refuses all resolve to undefined and render as empty — so the operator
    sees a working template with a hole in it and no reason for the hole.

    The fix is NOT to make the preview strict. The preview must render under
    the same rules as the mail, or it is not a preview — so this behaves
    exactly like `Undefined` and only records.

    **The list lives in a ContextVar, not on the class.** The first version

    contamination: `preview_template` is a sync `def`, so FastAPI runs it in a
    threadpool, and with sixteen concurrent previews three returned another
    request's variable names and two returned none of their own. Invisible on
    a desktop; Server Edition serves a LAN, and two bookkeepers previewing at
    once got each other's. anyio copies the context per task, so a ContextVar
    is isolated per request.

    **Only a RENDER is recorded.** `{% if pay_url %}` asks whether something
    is there; that is a guard doing its job, not a hole. Reporting it would
    flag the shipped default template on every preview, which is a false
