# ============================================================================
# The folder earlier versions shared between companies — and clearing it.
#
# Before 2.18.0 every company on an install wrote its uploads into one
# folder, storage.uploads_root(). Each company now keeps its files in its own
# database (file_store.py); the upgrade (migration c5e1f7a9b3d2) copies a
# company's files in from the folder once, the first time that company is
# opened on 2.18. After that nothing reads the folder, but it still holds
# every old logo, attachment and employee document (W-4s, I-9s, vendor
# W-9s), including the old copy of anything deleted since.
#
# It can't be cleared automatically: a company not yet opened on 2.18 still
# has to copy its files from it, and nothing records which company a file
# belongs to. So an administrator clears it from Settings, once no company
# on the install still needs it. The removal takes only regular files inside
# the folder and the folders they leave empty: never the folder itself (on
# Docker it is a volume's mount point), never anything reached through a
# link, never anything outside it.
