# Extracted verbatim from the Stripe webhook handler so PayPal/Square get

# instead of re-implementing (and drifting from) it.

    any non-2xx; two deliveries can land milliseconds apart (and a poll can
    race a webhook). A plain check-then-insert against Payment.reference
    would let both pass the existence guard and create two payments.
