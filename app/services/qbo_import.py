# ============================================================================
# QBO Import Service — Pull data from QuickBooks Online into FlowBooks
#
# Import order follows the same dependency chain as IIF import:
#   accounts -> customers -> vendors -> items -> invoices -> payments
#
# Each entity type: query QBO -> check qbo_mappings for existing ->
# check by name/docnum for duplicates -> create or skip -> record mapping.
#
# QBO REST API returns Python objects via python-quickbooks SDK.
# All QBO object field access uses getattr(obj, field, None) for safety.
