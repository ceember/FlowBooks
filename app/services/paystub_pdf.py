# Pay Stub PDF — itemized employee earnings statement
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Renders a printable pay stub carrying every field California Labor Code 226
# requires: gross wages, hours worked (with the regular/OT/double-time split),
# each deduction itemized individually, net wages, pay-period dates, employee
# identification (name + last-4 SSN) and employer identification, plus
# current-period and year-to-date columns.
#
# Deduction line items are read from PayStub.detail_json (a JSON string of
# {label: amount}); when absent, the explicit stub columns are used instead.
