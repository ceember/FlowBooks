# `min_length` alone is not enough: a name of "   " has length 3 and passes,
# producing a record that is invisible in list views and unsearchable — there
# is nothing to click and nothing to type to find it again. strip_whitespace
# runs BEFORE the length check, so "   " collapses to "" and is rejected, and
# a padded "  Acme  " is stored cleanly as "Acme".
#
# max_length mirrors the VARCHAR(200) width shared by Customer.name and
# Vendor.name. Validating here keeps the two supported backends consistent:
# PostgreSQL raises StringDataRightTruncation (an opaque HTTP 500) while
# SQLite ignores VARCHAR(n) and stores the oversized value.
# A stored email address. Deliberately a permissive shape check, not RFC 5322
# validation: the goal is to reject "not-an-email", which was accepted and
# stored verbatim, without pulling in the email-validator dependency that
# pydantic.EmailStr requires — requirements.txt is tightly pinned with CVE
# rationale per line and is not somewhere to add a dependency casually.
