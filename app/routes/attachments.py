# ============================================================================
# Attachments — file upload/download for invoices, bills, etc.
# Phase 10: Quick Wins + Medium Effort Features
#
# The bytes are kept in the company's own database (stored_files, see
# app/services/file_store.py). They used to be written to
# uploads/attachments/<type>/<record id>/<name> in a folder every company on
# a desktop install shared, so company B's invoice 1 "receipt.pdf" replaced
# company A's, and deleting B's made A's answer 404 (2.18.0 gate, skytech).
