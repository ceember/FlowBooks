# ============================================================================
# File Uploads — the company logo, and the folder earlier versions shared
# Feature 15: Infrastructure D (UploadFile pattern)
#
# The logo is kept in the company's own database (app/services/file_store.py),
# not in the uploads folder every company on a desktop install shared: there
# it was one file, company_logo.<ext>, so one company's upload became every
# company's logo (2.18.0 gate, macbase1 NEW-14 and skytech).
#
# /legacy is that shared folder: an administrator sees what it still holds
# and removes it once every company has copied its files in
# (app/services/legacy_uploads.py).
