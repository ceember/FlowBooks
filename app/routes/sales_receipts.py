# Enter Sales Receipts — invoice + payment recorded as one step, for
# point-of-sale style transactions where payment happens at the sale.
#
# Composes the existing invoice and payment routes rather than re-posting
# journals itself, so numbering, closing-date checks, FX, inventory/COGS,
# and void semantics stay identical to documents entered separately.
