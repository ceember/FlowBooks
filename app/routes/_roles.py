"""Who is asking: the role behind a request, for routes that shape their
answer by it (the RBAC middleware in app.main decides allow/deny; this is
for the allowed-but-narrower case).

A session carries its role; an API token carries its own (the middleware
stamps ``request.state.token_principal``). A legacy single-user session has
no role and is the admin."""
