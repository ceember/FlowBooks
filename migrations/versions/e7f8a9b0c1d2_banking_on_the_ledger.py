"""banking on the ledger (issue #114)

The bank register was a side ledger: register entries and imported
statement lines never posted, posting documents never appeared in the
register, and reconciliation ticked rows the general ledger had never
seen (discussion #112, a QuickBooks user asking why GL 1000 did not move).

From 2.10 the general ledger is the only ledger. This revision adds what
that needs and moves nothing of value:

- accounts.bank_kind ("bank" | "credit_card"): which chart accounts are
  bank or card accounts. Backfilled from the seeded numbers, from names,
  and from every account a bank feed already links to.
- transaction_lines.cleared / reconciliation_id: a line on a bank account
  is cleared by a matched statement line or a reconciliation tick, and
  carries the reconciliation that closed it.
- bank_accounts.balance -> legacy_balance: the register's own balance is
  retired; the number is kept for the one-time "post as opening balance /
  dismiss" banner. NO journal entry is posted here — a migration must not
  write ledger lines the user has not reviewed, and an install that also
  used Opening Balances would be double-counted.
- bank_accounts without a linked account get a bank-kind asset account
  created and linked (name = feed name, next free 10x0 number).
- bank_transactions.transaction_line_id: a statement line links to the
  exact line it matches (a transfer has two bank lines).
- reconciliations.account_id / beginning_balance / cleared_total;
  bank_account_id becomes nullable (pre-2.10 rows keep it).
- bank_transactions.match_status: rows ticked in the old side ledger
  become "excluded" (Restore brings one back); everything else "unmatched"
  (an old "auto" keeps the category a rule assigned).
