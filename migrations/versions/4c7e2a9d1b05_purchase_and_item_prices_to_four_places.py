"""purchase line and item prices to four decimal places; bills get due dates

Sub-cent unit prices (6f57f762f464) reached the sales lines only, but the
case that asked for them was a purchase: cake boxes bought at $0.045 each
(2.17.3 exploratory, macbase1 S-f). The rate on bill, purchase order and
vendor credit lines, and an item's rate and standard cost, go from
Numeric(15, 2) to Numeric(17, 4): the same thirteen integer digits as the
money columns, two more places, so no stored value changes. Line amounts
stay Numeric(15, 2), rounded to the cent. The downgrade rounds them back.

Bills made from a purchase order before this release were saved with terms
and no due date, so they never aged (macbase1 F10). Each one now gets the
due date its date and terms give, by the rule bills and invoices use:
"Due on Receipt" (or COD, Net 0) is the bill's date, "Net N" is N days on,
other nonblank terms 30. Unknown (blank or null) terms keep their missing
due date. The downgrade leaves the dates: they are right either way.
